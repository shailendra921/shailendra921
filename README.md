Hi, My name is shailendra dhakad. I am a 3rd year student at MITS. As I always wondered from my childhood about how this internet and it's webpages work, so i chose to be an web developer. Now, finally I am a frontend web developer who have excellent skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and also I have experience of making good responsive webpages, also i am familier with React.js to showcase my skillset.
